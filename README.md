👋 Hi, I’m @akkicodes-dev

👀 I’m passionate about coding, web development, and leveraging technology to create meaningful solutions. I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into reality through code.

🌱 I’m currently learning creative web development, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and exploring full-stack development to strengthen my problem-solving and programming skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, hackathons, innovative web and app development ideas, and DSA-related coding challenges. I enjoy brainstorming and working on challenging problems with like-minded individuals.
